# JARVIS Changelog

## [2026-02-24] - Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Upgrade + LLM Test Suite + Voice Fixes

### Major Features
- **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Model Upgrade** — `llama-server.service`
  - MoE architecture: 35B total params, 256 experts, 8+1 active (~3B active)
  - Q3_K_M quantization (unsloth, imatrix-calibrated), 16GB model file
  - 48-63 tok/s (comparable to old 8B dense), IFEval 91.9 (was ~70s)
  - VRAM: 19.5/20.5 GB (~1 GB headroom), `--parallel 1` for single-user
  - Replaces Qwen3-VL-8B Q5_K_M

### Testing
- **Tier 4 LLM test suite** — 28 automated tests validating live model responses
  - System prompt adherence (5): no-filler, imperial units, brevity, date awareness
  - Personality & opinions (3): no "as an AI", humor, warmth
  - Tool calling (4): search when needed, restrain when not
  - Structured output (2): clean JSON extraction
  - Multi-turn context (2): fact recall, topic tracking
  - Safety & refusal (3): phishing, prompt injection, malware
  - Hallucination resistance (2): fake entities correctly rejected
  - Technical knowledge (4): cybersecurity, Python, Linux, code gen
  - Voice assistant fitness (3): conversational flow, brevity, imperial
  - Total suite: 180/180 (Tier 1: 39, Tier 2: 113, Tier 4: 28)
  - Requires llama-server running; skips gracefully when unavailable

### Bug Fixes
- **Web search routing** — removed "search" keyword alias that hard-routed all search commands to browser instead of LLM web research pipeline. Site-specific searches (YouTube, Google) still route correctly via keyword/semantic matching
- **Ack speaker-to-mic bleed** — added 0.35s acoustic settling delay in `resume_listening()` to prevent TTS echo from re-triggering intents
- **Whisper correction** — added "quinn" → "qwen" transcription correction

---

## [2026-02-23] - Demo Prep + LLM Metrics + 4 Bug Fixes

### Major Features
- **LLM Metrics Dashboard (5 phases)** — `core/metrics_tracker.py`, `jarvis_web.py`, `web/metrics.html`
  - Real-time tracking of LLM calls: tokens, latency, local vs API, quality gate retries
  - Web dashboard at `/metrics` with charts, tables, and summary stats
  - Persistent SQLite storage with 30-day retention
  - Per-skill and per-model breakdowns
- **jarvis-web.service** — systemd user service for web UI, auto-start after jarvis.service

### Bug Fixes
- **Web research page fetch timeout** — 20s+ → ~5s. Replaced `trafilatura.fetch_url()` with `requests.get(timeout=4)` + manual `pool.shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)`
- **Desktop manager init order** — skills loaded before desktop manager was created → "not available" for all window management. Moved init before skill loading
- **Health check PipeWire mic detection** — `sounddevice.query_devices()` misses PipeWire USB devices. Added `pactl list sources short` fallback
- **Audio output PipeWire routing** — changed `output_device: plughw:0,0` → `output_device: default` for PipeWire compatibility (enables OBS coexistence)

### Other Changes
- Preferred-mic hot-swap recovery — device monitor recovers from wrong-mic fallback after boot race
- Ack speaker-to-mic bleed fix — mic paused during ack playback
- Whisper brand-name corrections — "and videos"→"amd's", "in video"→"nvidia"
- WebUI health check spoken/on-screen mismatch fixed
- Edge case tests expanded to 152 (from 144)
