# JARVIS Edge Case Testing Plan

**Created:** February 20, 2026 (session 30)
**Purpose:** Systematic adversarial testing to catch edge cases across all subsystems
**Method:** Phased execution — work through one phase per session, track results inline
**Status Legend:** `[ ]` untested | `[P]` pass | `[F]` fail | `[S]` skip (not applicable)

---

## Automated Test Suite

The automated test harness (`scripts/test_edge_cases.py`) validates routing and unit-level behavior
by injecting text directly into the pipeline — no voice/mic/TTS needed.

**Current results: 122/122 (100%) — Tier 1: 39/39 | Tier 2: 83/83**

### Quick Reference

```bash
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py              # Tiers 1+2 (default)
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --tier 1     # Unit tests only (<1s)
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --tier 2     # Routing tests only (~5s load)
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --phase 1A   # Single phase
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --id 1A-01   # Single test
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --verbose     # Show all tests (not just failures)
python3 scripts/test_edge_cases.py --json        # JSON output
```

### Tiers

| Tier | Scope | Tests | Load Time | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Unit | 39 | <1s | Ambient filter (13), noise filter (7), TTS normalizer (14), speech chunker (5) |
| 2 | Routing | 83 | ~5s | Intent routing (40), priority chain/state machines (18), skill validation (23), priority ordering (2) |
| 3 | Execution | — | Future | Run skill handlers, validate response content |
| 4 | Pipeline | — | Future | Full pipeline with LLM server running |

### Production Bug Found

The automated suite uncovered a **crash bug** in `skill_manager.py:execute_intent()`:
developer_tools uses a 2-tuple `(command, expiry)` for `_pending_confirmation` while
`execute_intent()` assumed all skills use file_editor's 3-tuple `(action, detail, expiry)`.
When developer_tools ran a handler that set a 2-tuple confirmation, the next call to
`execute_intent()` crashed with `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)`.
**Fixed:** Added tuple-length guard at line 472 — only processes 3-tuple confirmations via the
centralized path; skills with other formats handle confirmations internally.

---

## Phase 1: Intent Routing Stress Test

The routing system (4 layers + priority chain) is the most historically buggy area. These tests probe ambiguous commands, keyword conflicts, and layer transitions.

**Round 1:** 26/40 pass (65%) — 14 failures
**Round 2:** 29/40 pass (72.5%) — 5 fixed, 2 regressions, 6 persistent. Fixes: `50e50eb` `a5e2ccc`
**Round 3:** 37/40 pass (92.5%) — all 8 R2 failures fixed. 3 reclassified (not bugs). Fixes: `d4c8324` (F1-F7) + weather intent_id collision fix.
**Root cause of persistent 1A-11/1D-02:** `register_semantic_intent()` generates intent_id from handler name — 3 weather intents sharing `get_current_weather` silently overwrote each other, discarding 13 of 18 examples. Fixed by merging into single registration + adding duplicate-ID warning guard.

### 1A. Ambiguous Verb Routing

Commands where the verb maps to multiple skills. The correct skill should win.

| ID | Test Input | Expected Skill | Expected Intent | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|----------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1A-01 | "delete the test file from the share" | file_editor | delete_file | [P] | R1P R2P — Correct skill and handler |
| 1A-02 | "delete my dentist reminder" | reminders | cancel_reminder | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F1 (ambiguous suffix disambiguation via semantic similarity) |
| 1A-03 | "forget that I like coffee" | memory_manager | forget (Priority 3) | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-04 | "remove the meeting from my calendar" | reminders | cancel_reminder | [P] | R1F R2P — **FIXED** by +calendar/meeting/appointment keywords |
| 1A-05 | "open chrome" | app_launcher | launch_app | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-06 | "open the article" | news (Priority 5) | article pull-up | [F] | R1F(app_launcher) R2F(LLM). **Not a routing bug** — pull-up needs prior news read to set `get_last_read_url()`. Test needs context setup. |
| 1A-07 | "search for python tutorials" | web_navigation | search_web | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-08 | "search codebase for database" | developer_tools | codebase_search | [P] | R1F R2P — **FIXED** by keyword tie-breaking |
| 1A-09 | "find my config file" | filesystem | file_search | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F5 (find_file threshold 0.70→0.55, +example) |
| 1A-10 | "find files containing error" | developer_tools | codebase_search | [P] | R1P R2P (keyword_global_semantic path) |
| 1A-11 | "what's the weather in the news" | weather | current_weather | [P] | R1P R2F R3P — **FIXED.** Root cause: intent_id collision — 3 weather intents shared `get_current_weather` handler, last registration (4 temp examples) silently overwrote first (9 general examples including this test phrase). Fix: merged into single registration (18 examples, threshold 0.60). |
| 1A-12 | "close the browser window" | app_launcher | close_app | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-13 | "show me my drives" | system_info | get_all_drives | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-14 | "show me the git diff" | developer_tools | git_diff | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-15 | "write a reminder to call mom" | reminders | set_reminder | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-16 | "create a bash script for backups" | file_editor | write_file | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1A-17 | "edit the weather skill" | file_editor | edit_file | [P] | R1P R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F4 (+example "edit the weather skill") |

### 1B. Substring & Word Boundary Traps

Tests for the `"no" in "diagnostic"` class of bugs. All keyword matching should use `\b` word boundaries.

| ID | Test Input | Should NOT Match | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1B-01 | "run a full system health diagnostic" | "no" bare ack | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1B-02 | "what's the weather forecast" | "cast" (if any keyword) | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1B-03 | "tell me about the amazon rainforest" | web_nav amazon_search | [P] | R1F R2P — **FIXED** by adding "amazon" to _generic_keywords |
| 1B-04 | "open the storage drives panel" | "open" generic → wrong skill | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1B-05 | "is the event happening tomorrow" | reminders (event keyword) | [F] | R1F(weather) R2F(llm_fallback+web search). "event" keyword removed — no false reminders match. LLM web search is reasonable for ambiguous input. |
| 1B-06 | "the application crashed" | app_launcher (application keyword) | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F7 (close_app threshold 0.48→0.55, example swap) |
| 1B-07 | "I acknowledge that" | reminders acknowledge_current | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1B-08 | "what time does the news come on" | time_info or news? | [P] | R1P R2P |

### 1C. Generic Keyword Blocklist Bypass

The `_generic_keywords` blocklist (search, open, find, look, browse, navigate, web, file, code, directory, count, analyze) should prevent false suffix matches but not block legitimate routing.

| ID | Test Input | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1C-01 | "search" (bare word) | LLM fallback (no skill match) | [P] | R1F R2P R3P — Transient crash in R3 batch run (heap corruption from prior tests); passes on clean restart. Web search fallback is expected LLM behavior. |
| 1C-02 | "open" (bare word) | LLM fallback | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F2 (bare word guard moved to match_intent, blocks all layers) |
| 1C-03 | "file" (bare word) | LLM fallback | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED** by F2 (same root cause as 1C-02) |
| 1C-04 | "search youtube for music" | web_navigation youtube_search | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1C-05 | "analyze this script" | filesystem script_analysis | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1C-06 | "count lines in my project" | filesystem count_code_lines | [P] | R1F(llm_fallback) R2P — **FIXED** by +filesystem keywords. Note: count_code_lines IS the correct handler (no "code_analysis" intent exists). Test expectation corrected. |
| 1C-07 | "navigate to workspace 2" | app_launcher switch_workspace | [P] | R1P R2P |

### 1D. Layer Transition Edge Cases

Commands that should escalate through routing layers (exact → fuzzy → keyword → semantic → LLM).

| ID | Test Input | Expected Layer | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1D-01 | "what's up" | Layer 1/2 (exact/fuzzy) | conversation whats_up | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1D-02 | "could you perhaps look into the current meteorological conditions" | Global semantic | weather current_weather | [P] | R1F R2F R3P — **FIXED.** Same root cause as 1A-11 (intent_id collision discarded the meteorological example). LLM web search for local weather also acceptable behavior. |
| 1D-03 | "yo what time is it bro" | Semantic | time_info time_query | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1D-04 | "tell me something interesting" | LLM fallback | Qwen response | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1D-05 | "how do I make pasta" | LLM fallback (or web) | Qwen/web research | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1D-06 | "jarvis" (bare wake word, no command) | Noise filter or LLM | Should not crash | [P] | R1P R2P — console routes to developer_tools/service_status via semantic (voice mode opens conversation window) |
| 1D-07 | "" (empty string) | Noise filter | Silently ignored | [P] | R1P R2P |
| 1D-08 | "um" | Noise filter | `_is_conversation_noise()` | [P] | R1F R2P — **FIXED** by console noise filter |

## How to Test

### Voice Mode (Production)
```bash
systemctl --user restart jarvis
journalctl --user -u jarvis -f    # Watch logs
# Speak test commands and verify routing in logs
```

### Console Mode (Faster Iteration)
```bash
python3 jarvis_console.py
# Type test commands, check [ROUTING] log lines
```

### Web UI
```bash
jarvis_webserver_start    # or: python3 jarvis_web.py
# Open http://localhost:8765 in browser
```

### Checking Routing Decisions
Look for these log patterns:
- `[SKILL_MANAGER]` — which layer matched, which skill/intent
- `[PIPELINE]` — which priority level handled the command
- `[MEMORY]` — fact storage/recall operations
- `[TTS]` — which engine spoke, chunk delivery
- `[STT]` — transcription text and confidence
