# TODO — Next Session

**Updated:** February 22, 2026

---

## Tier 1: High ROI — Do Now/Soon

### ~~1. Edge Case Testing Phase 2~~ — COMPLETE (28/30 automated)
**Status:** DONE. 132 tests total (39 unit + 93 routing). 4 deferred to future feature (mid-rundown interruption).
**See:** `docs/EDGE_CASE_TESTING.md` for full results.

### 2. Inject User Facts into Web Research
**Priority:** HIGH
**Concept:** JARVIS reasons about what it knows about the user (location, preferences) during `stream_with_tools()`.
**Risk:** History poisoning — needs careful scoping.

### 3. Document Generation Skill (#42)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Concept:** "Write a report on..." → structured document output (Markdown/PDF).

---

## Tier 2: Medium ROI — Next Wave

### 4. Email Skill (Gmail Integration)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Concept:** Voice-composed email via Gmail API + OAuth (same pattern as Calendar).
**Design:** `.archive/docs/MASTER_DESIGN.md` has contact DB schema and feature list.

### 5. Google Keep Integration
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Concept:** "Add milk to the grocery list." Shared access with secondary user.

### 6. Audio Recording Skill
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Location:** `skills/personal/audio_recording/`
**Concept:** Voice-triggered recording with natural playback queries.
- "Record audio" → tone → capture → "Stop recording" → saved as WAV
- "Play the recording from yesterday" → date-based lookup + playback
- 6 semantic intents (start, stop, play, query, list, export)

---

## Tier 3: Lower Effort — When Ready

### 7. "Onscreen Please" — Retroactive Visual Display
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Concept:** Buffer last raw output. "Onscreen please" displays it retroactively.

### 8. Music Control (Apple Music)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Concept:** Playlist learning, volume via PulseAudio. Apple Music web interface is finicky.
**Design:** `.archive/docs/MASTER_DESIGN.md` has playlist DB schema.

### 9. LLM-Centric Architecture Migration
**Priority:** MEDIUM (wait for Qwen 3.5 release)
**Design:** `docs/DEVELOPMENT_VISION.md`
**Concept:** Skills become tools, not destinations. Incremental migration.

---

## Tier 4: Backlog

### Skill Editing System
**Design:** `docs/SKILL_EDITING_SYSTEM.md`
**Concept:** "Edit the weather skill" → LLM code gen → review → apply with backup.
**Note:** VS Code + Claude Code is faster for editing skills in practice.

### STT Worker Process
**Design:** `docs/STT_WORKER_PROCESS.md`
**Concept:** GPU isolation via separate process. Only needed if GPU conflicts resurface.

### Automated Skill Generation
**Concept:** Q&A → build → test → review → deploy. Depends on Skill Editing.

### Mobile Access
**Concept:** Remote command via phone. Different tech stack entirely.

## Tier 5: Aspirational — Someday/Maybe

- **Malware Analysis Framework** — QEMU sandbox, VirusTotal/Any.run API, CISA-format reports. Build when a specific engagement needs it.
- **Video / Face Recognition** — webcam → people/pets/objects. Hardware-dependent.
- **Tor / Dark Web Research** — Brave Tor mode, safety protocols. Specialized professional use.
- **Emotional context awareness** — laugh/frustration/distress detection. Research-level ML.
- **Voice cloning (Paul Bettany)** — tested Coqui, rejected. Revisit when open-source matures.
- **Proactive AI** — suggest actions based on patterns. Needs significant usage data first.
- **Self-modification** — JARVIS proposes own improvements. Far future.
- **Home automation** — IoT integration. Hardware-dependent.

## Active Bugs

None!

---

## Minor Loose Ends

- **VOICE TEST: Smart ack suppression** — Implemented (Feb 22). Needs live voice restart + verification: conversational queries → no ack, research/complex → ack fires. See `memory/handoff_session40_feb22.md`.
- **Voice testing: bare ack as answer** — JARVIS asks question → "yeah" → treated as answer (needs reliable trigger)
- **Batch extraction (Phase 4) untested** — conversational memory batch fact extraction needs 25+ messages in one session to trigger
